When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you wish to share your work others and or allow others to collaborate and contribute to your work/repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because not all the changes.commits you want to bring in automatically from the remote repo. You might want to experiment on certain commits earlier in the history.
